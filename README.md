About the task:

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model built on a comprehensive housing dataset. The process involved exploring the data to understand its structure, cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values and outliers, and analyzing relationships between features and the target variable. By leveraging advanced techniques in feature engineering and model evaluation, we aimed to build an accurate and interpretable predictive model.

About the task:

The Titanic dataset task is a foundational machine learning problem where you predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on provided features such as age, gender, ticket class, family relationships, and fare. The training dataset includes the "Survived" column (the target variable), which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0). Using this data, you train a machine learning model to make predictions. The test dataset does not include the survival outcomes, so our goal is to use the trained model to predict the survival for these passengers.
